# What are Terraform Modules
* Terraform module is collection of terraform configuration files that are grouped together to create reusable infra.
* It's like a templates you can call it wherever you want, instead of copying-pasting the same code again and again.
* It help us to build infrastructure faster, cleaner, and smarter."

### For example:
* You create a module to launch an EC2 instance.
* Then you can call that same module in dev, staging, and prod ‚Äî just with different variables (like AMI ID, subnet, etc.).*

## Real-Time Advantages of Using Modules
1. Reusability
You write once, use anywhere ‚Äî no need to duplicate code.

2. Consistency
All environments (dev, staging, prod) follow the same structure ‚Äî less chance of mistakes.

3. Easier to Maintain
Update a module in one place, and all the environments get the fix ‚Äî saves time and avoids human errors.

4. Separation of Concerns
Each module focuses on a specific task: VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB, etc. Makes the code clean and understandable.

5. Team Collaboration
Different team members can own different modules (like networking team owns VPC module, app team owns EC2 module).


## üõ†Ô∏è Real-Time Example:
Let‚Äôs say your project has:
  * 3 EC2 instances (frontend, backend, and DB)
  * In 3 environments (dev, staging, prod)

### Without modules:
* You‚Äôd be copying EC2 code block 9 times (3 x 3), which is boring, error-prone, and hard to maintain.
### With modules:
* You create 1 EC2 module and reuse it by just changing the inputs.
